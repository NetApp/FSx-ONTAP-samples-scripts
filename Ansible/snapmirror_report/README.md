# Ansible SnapMirror Report
This Ansible playbook generates a report of all the FSx for ONTAP SnapMirror relationships within an AWS account.
The output of the report is a CSV file with the following columns:
- File System ID
- Source Path (svm:volume)
- Destination Path (svm:volume)
- State (e.g. snapmirrored, broken-off)
- Healthy (true or false)
- lag\_time (in "P#DT#H#M#S" format)

## Requirements
- Ansible 2.9 or later
- AWS collection

## Installation
There are three files used to create the report:
- `generate_report.yaml`: The Ansible playbook that generates the report.
- `processs_region.yaml`: A collection of tasks that will process all the FSxNs in a region.
- `get_all_fsxn_regions.yaml`: A collection of tasks that retrieves all the regions, that are enabled for the account, where FSx for ONTAP is available.

You will also need to create a file named (by default) `secrets_list.csv` that list the secret name for each FSx file system.
The format of the file should be:
```
file_system_id,secret_name
```
You should have all four of these files in a single directory.

## Configuration
There are a few variables that can be changed at the top of the `generate_report.yaml` file:
- report\_name - Sets the file path of the report that will be generated. 
- secrets\_list\_file - Sets the file path of the file that contains the list of FSx file systems and their secrets.
- secrets\_region - Set the region where the secrets are stored.

## Usage
To generate the report, run the following command:
```bash
ansible-playbook generate_report.yaml
```
After a successful run, the report will be saved to the file path specified in the `report_name` variable.
