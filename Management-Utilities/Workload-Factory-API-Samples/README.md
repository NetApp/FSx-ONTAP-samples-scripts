# Workload Factory API Samples

The idea behind this folder is to show examples of how to use the [BlueXP Workload Factory APIs](https://console.workloads.netapp.com/api-doc).
Not every API is covered, but the ones required to get you started (get a refresh token, get the BlueXP accountID,
get BlueXP credentials ID) are included. Once you have the informaiton provided from these APIs are ready to start
calling the others. While these examples are implemented as bash shell scripts you should be able to translate them
to the programming language that you prefer, such as Python, Go, or JavaScript.

Note that all these scripts depend on the [wf_utils](wf_utils) file that contains common functions used by all the
scripts. One function in particular, `get_token()`, is used to get an authentication token from the BlueXP Workload
Factory API. So, if you copy just some of the files from this repository, make sure to copy the `wf_utils` file as well.

## Prerequisites
To run these scripts, you need to have the following prerequisites:
- A bash shell.
- The `curl` command-line tool installed.
- The `jq` command-line JSON processor installed. You can install it using your package manager, e.g., `apt-get install jq` on Debian/Ubuntu or `brew install jq` on macOS.

## Notes:
- All scripts allow you to set environment variables to pass options instead of having to use the
command line options. For example, instead of using the `-t` option to pass the
[BlueXP Refresh Token](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-automation/platform/create_user_token.html#1-generate-a-netapp-refresh-token),
you can set the `REFRESH_TOKEN` environment variable.

- All scripts accept the `-h` option to display the help message, which includes the available options and their descriptions.

Hopefully with these samples you'll be able to create your own scripts that use any the Workload Factory APIs.
If you do create a new script, please consider contributing it back to this repository so that others can benefit from it.
