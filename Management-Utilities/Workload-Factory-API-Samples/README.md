# Workload Factory API Samples

This folder contains various bash shell scripts that demonstrate how to use the Workload Factory APIs to perform an action.
They all depend on the [wf_utils](wf_utils) file that contains common functions used by all the scripts. One function
in particular, `get_token()`, is used to get an authentication token from the BlueXP Workload Factory API. So, if you
copy just some of the files from this repository, make sure to copy the `wf_utils` file as well.

## Prerequisites
To run these scripts, you need to have the following prerequisites:
- A bash shell.
- The `curl` command-line tool installed.
- The `jq` command-line JSON processor installed. You can install it using your package manager, e.g., `apt-get install jq` on Debian/Ubuntu or `brew install jq` on macOS.

## Notes:
- All scripts allow you to set environment variables to pass options instead of having to use the
command line options. For example, instead of using the `-t` option to pass the
[BlueXP Refresh Token](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-automation/platform/create_user_token.html#1-generate-a-netapp-refresh-token),
you can set the `REFRESH_TOKEN` environment variable.

- All scripts use the `-h` option to display the help message, which includes the available options and their descriptions.

Hopefully with these samples you'll be able to create your own scripts that use any the Workload Factory APIs.
If you do create a new script, please consider contributing it back to this repository so that others can benefit from it.
