# Warm Performance (SSD) test for FSx for ONTAP volume

## Introduction
This sample provides a script that can be used to warm FSx for ONTAP
volume. In other words, it ensures all the blocks for a volume are in
the "performance tier" as opposed to the "capacity tier." It does that
simply by reading every byte of every file in the volume. Doing that
causes any block that is currently in the capacity tier to be pull
into the performance tier before being returned to the reader. At that point,
assuming the tiering policy is not set to 'all', all the data should remain
in the performance tier until the policy tiers it back out to the capacity tier.

To speed up the process, the script will spawn multiple threads to process
the volume. It will spawn a separate thread for each directory
in the volume, and then a separate thread for each file in that directory.
The number of directory threads is controlled by the -t option. The number
of reader threads is controlled by the -x option. Note that the script
will spawn -x reader threads **per** directory thread. So, if you have 4
directory threads and 10 reader threads, you could have up to 40 reader
threads running at one time.

You can specify a FSx for ONTAP file system data endpoint and a volume
name to the script and it will attempt to mount the volume if it isn't already.
If it does mount it, it will mount it read-only and unmount
when it is done. The script assume that the junction path is the same
as the volume name. If this isn't the case, then just mount the volume
before running the script and provide the path to the mount point
with the -d option.

## Set Up
The script is meant to be run on a Linux based host that is able to NFS
mount the volume to be warmed. If the volume is already mounted, then
any user that has read access to the files in the volume can run it.
Otherwise, the script needs to be run as 'root' so it can mount the
volume before reading the files.

Once the volume has been mounted, then the script should be run by
a user that has read access to all the files in the volume.

Of course it only make sense to have the tiering policy on the volume
set to something other than "all", otherwise the script will be ineffective.

# Running The Script
To run the script you just need to change the UNIX permissions on the file to be executable, then run it as a command:
```
chmod +x warm_performance_tier
 ./warm_performance_tier -d /path/to/mount/point
```
The above example will force the script to read every file in the /path/to/mount/point directory.

If you want to script to ensure the volume is mounted, you can specify the filesystem endpoint and volume name:
```
./warm_performance_tier -f fsxfileserver.us-west-2.amazonaws.com -v myvolume
```
By default there won't be any output from the script. You can provide a -V option to
get verbose output. This will display the thread ID, date (in epoch seconds), then the
directory or file being processed.

If you run the script with a '-h' option, you will see the following help message:
```
Usage: warm_performance_tier [-f filesystem_endpoint] [-v volume_name] [-d directory] [-t max_directory_threads] [-x max_read_threads] [-n nfs_type] [-h] [-V]
where
  -f filesystem_endpoint - Is the hostname or IP address of the FSx for ONTAP file system.
  -v volume_name - Is the ID of the volume.
  -n nfs_type - Is the NFS version to use. Default is nfs4.
  -d directory - Is the root directory to start the process from.
  -t max_directory_threads - Is the maximum number of threads to use to process directories. Default is 10.
  -x max_read_threads - Is the maximum number of threads to use to read files. Default is 4.
  -V - Enable verbose output. Displays the thread ID, date (in epoch seconds), then the directory or file being processed.
  -h - Prints this help information.

Notes:
  * The filesystem_endpoint, volume_name and nfs_type are used to mount the volume
    if it is not already mounted. It will be mounted read-only. It assumes that
    the junction path is the same as the volume name.
  * For each directory thread, there will be a maximum of max_read_threads threads
    reading files.
