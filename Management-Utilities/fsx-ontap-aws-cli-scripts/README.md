# FSxN Convenience Scripts
This folder contains sample scripts that are designed to help you use FSxN from
a command line. Most of the scripts are written in Bash, intended to be run either from
a UNIX based O/S (e.g. Linux, MacOS, FreeBSD), or from a Microsoft Windows based system with a
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) based Linux distribution installed.

## Preparation
Before running the UNIX based scripts, make sure the following package is installed:

* jq  - lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor
* aws-cli - Command Line Interface for AWS
