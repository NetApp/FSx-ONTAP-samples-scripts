# Deploy DR FSx ONTAP cluster and create SnapMirror relationships from source FSxN

## Introduction
This repository contains a method to take an existing FSxN system and replicate volumes to a new FSx ONTAP instance for disaster recovery or backup purposes.  It leverages both AWS FSx Terraform provider as well as the ONTAP Terraform provider.

## Setup

You will need to define some key characteristics of the destination FSxN cluster that will be created, such as deployment type and througput, full list below.  You also will need to define the source SVM and list of volumes to replicate, and replication parameters.

These values can be found in the following variables files: Primary_FSxN_variables.tf and DR_FSxN_variables.tf

## Prerequisites
You have an existing FSx ONTAP system that you want to replicate to a new FSxN system.  There is proper networking connectivy between the source FSxN system and the region/VPC/subnets where the destination FSxN system will be deployed.

SnapMirror replication requires **ICMP** and ports **11104** and **11105**.
