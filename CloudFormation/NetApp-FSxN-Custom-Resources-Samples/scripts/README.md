|createClone.py | This is a Python script that will create a clone of a volume using boto to deploy a CloudFormation stack that creates a clone.|

## Usage
To run these scripts you'll need to download them, change the permissions to be executable, and then run them. For example:
```bash
chmod +x create_volume
./create_volme -r us-west-2 -l arn:aws:lambda:ca-central-1:759999999999:function:wf-link -s arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:759999999999:secret:fsnSecret-yyaL32 -f fs-02a89999999999999 -v prod -n vol1 -t ../create_volume.yaml
```

To see the required parameters for each script, you can run the script with the `-h` flag. For example:
```bash
./create_volume -h
Usage: create_volume [-r region] -l link_ARN -s secret_ARN [-k secret_key] -f fsx_id -v svm_name -n volune_name [-z size_in_MB] [-a aggregate] -t template
Notes:
  The default region is the region configured in the AWS CLI.
  The default secret key is 'credentials'.
  The default aggregate is "aggr1".
  The default size is 20MB.
```
