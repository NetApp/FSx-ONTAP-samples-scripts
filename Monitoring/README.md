# Monitoring Overview
This subfolder contains tools that can help you monitor your FSx ONTAP file system(s).

The following tools provide for a graphical representation of the resource utilization of your FSx ONTAP file system:

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CloudWatch Dashboard for FSx for ONTAP](/Monitoring/CloudWatch-FSx) | This tool creates a CloudWatch dashboard that displays metrics for your FSx for ONTAP file system. |
| [monitor_fsxn_with_harvest_on_ec2](/Monitoring/monitor_fsxn_with_harvest_on_ec2) | This tool helps you install Harvest, and Prometheus with Grafana if needed, onto on ec2 instance so you can use them to monitor your FSx file systems. |
| [monitor_fsxn_with_harvest_on_eks](/Monitoring/monitor_fsxn_with_harvest_on_eks) | This tool helps you install Harvest, and Prometheus with Grafana if needed, into your EKS cluster so you can use them to monitor an FSx file system. |
| [LUN-monitoring](/Monitoring/LUN-monitoring) | This tool exports FSxN LUN metrics to CloudWatch and creates a CloudWatch dashboard to you can monitor your LUNs. Note that this information is now included in the CloudWatch dashboard mentioned above.|

These tools provide for a non-graphical monitoring of your FSx ONTAP file system. They are designed to send alerts when certain conditions are met:

| Tool | Description |
| [auto-add-cw-alarms](/Monitoring/auto-add-cw-alarms) | This tool will automatically add CloudWatch alarms that will alert you when:<br><ul><li>The utilization of the primary storage of any FSx ONTAP file system gets above a specified threshold.</li><li>The CPU utilization of any file system gets above a specified threshold.</li><li>The utilization of any volume within any file system gets above a specified threshold.</li></ul><br>Note that this functionality is included with the CloudWatch Dashboard mentioned above.|
| [monitor-ontap-services](/Monitoring/monitor-ontap-services)| This tool helps you monitor various Data ONTAP services and send SNS alerts if anything of interest is detected.
